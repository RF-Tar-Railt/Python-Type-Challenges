# How to add a new challange?

1. Fork this project if you haven't done so

2. Determine how difficult the challenge is. There are 4 levels: **basic**, **intermediate**, **advanced**, and **extreme**.

3. Create a new directory under [`challenges/`](https://github.com/laike9m/Python-Type-Challenges/tree/main/challenges). The new directory's name should follow the pattern `[basic|intermediate|advanced|extreme]-name`.

   For example, say you want to add a new challenge about [Protocols](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/protocols.html). Since this is an advanced topic, you may name the directory `advanced-protocol`.

4. Put a `question.py` and a `solution.py` in the new directory. Here's an example:
   ```python
   """
   TODO:

   foo should accept a dict argument, both keys and values are string.
   """

   def foo(x):
       pass

   def should_pass():
       foo({"foo": "bar"})

   def should_fail():
       foo({"foo": 1})
   ```

   You want to include several things in `question.py`

   - Describe the challenge, make sure people understand what they need to accomplish (the `TODO:` part)
   - Add two functions `should_pass` and `should_fail` as test cases. The **function names are mandatory**. With correct code, `should_pass` should pass type check, and `should_fail` should fail type check.

   Using the above challenge as an example, the correct answer is `def foo(x: dict[str, str]): pass`.

   This will pass type check:

   ```python
   def foo(x: dict[str, str]):
       pass

   def should_pass():
       foo({"foo": "bar"})
   ```

   This will fail type check

   ```python
   def foo(x: dict[str, str]):
       pass

   def should_fail():
       foo({"foo": 1})
   ```

   And the `solution.py` shall look like the same as `question.py`, except that it has a solution provided.

   ```python
   """
   TODO:

   foo should accept a dict argument, both keys and values are string.
   """

   def foo(x: dict[str, str]): pass

   def should_pass():
       foo({"foo": "bar"})

   def should_fail():
       foo({"foo": 1})
   ```

5. Test with [`mypy`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) to make sure your new challenge works as expected.
